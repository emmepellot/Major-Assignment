        <h2> What is the digital art movement?</h2>
        <p> The digital art movement is when the art space completely shifted due to the
            development of technology. It went from plain old physical hand-made copies to
            artists using the latest forms technologies to create fully digitalized and unique pieces of art.
            Everyday, thousands of people all over the world create their own forms of digital art. 
            Digital Art incorportates all styles of art including abstract, modern, pop art, virtual reality, 3D Renders,
            and more that are all done digitally.
        </p>
        <h3> Where It All Began</h3>
        <p2> One of the first examples of digital art is done by mathmetician Benjamin Laposky, who is credited with making the first
            computer graphics, utilizing an oscilloscope to create abstract art in the 1950s. He is credited as the earliest pioneer in electronic art,
            and many that came after him used his "oscillions" as examples to follow.  <br>
            <img class= "img2" style ="width: 15%" src="assets/history.jpeg"> <br>
            Throughout the 1960s, digital art was difficult to create for those who were not mathmeticians or programmers due to
            the lack of accessibility of computers. It was more in the mid 80s where artists no longer had to rely on their connections
            with scientists, mathmeticians, programmers, or university faculty to create their own digital artwork. By 1985, Windows Paint was released
            and by 1990, Adobe Photoshop was released. The 1991 creation of the World Wide Web was a great time for artists to come alive because more 
            and more computers were normalized in the household. 
            <img class= "img2" style ="width: 15%" src="assets/history2.png">
            With more computers and more programs to create art, digital art blossomed and became
            as popular as ever. Some at the time argued against digital art, saying the skill is lost through the hands of a computer mouse, but that
            is simply the main idea of the digital art movement; using new technologies to transform old fashioned art into a whole new world. <br>
